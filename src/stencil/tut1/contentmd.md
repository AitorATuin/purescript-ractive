# Welcome to tutorial 1!

In this tutorial we are going to see the most basic and straightforward use of `purescript-ractive`, we are use it
just to put some content in our page.

The content we want to show is this astounding greet:

```html
<h2 class="hello">Hej, hej VÃ¤rld!</h2>
```

It's just a H2 header with some greeting message (in Swedish ;)

The **purescript** snippet to do this is the following:

```haskell
import Control.Eff.Ractive

main :: Eff (ractiveM :: RactiveM) Unit
main = ractive "template" "#document" {}
```

<button class="btn btn-primary" on-click="run1">run</button>

### The code in more detail!
---
A short explanation about the code above;

* First we load the module with ```import Control.Eff.Ractive```
* Then, we define function which the only interesting thing that it does is to create a new ractive object.
To create it we pass three arguments to the _ractive_ function, the first one is the template we want to use (our nice greeting here),
the second one is the element where we want to show the message (all the element's children will be replaced!) and finally an object
with the data we want to bind (more on this later.)
* Please note that creating an object is a side-effect, so not allowed in a pure functional language like **purescript**,
that's the reason why _ractive_ function returns an _forall eff. Eff(ractiveM :: RactiveM) Ractive_.
See this [post](http://www.purescript.org/posts/Eff-Monad/ "Handling Native Effects with the Eff Monad") for a more detailed explanation.

### Functions involved here (and types)
---

Let's see the only function we have used here: _ractive_ and the type of it (we are now functional programmers so we really care about types!)

* **_ractive_** :: forall a eff. String -> String -> a -> Eff (ractiveM :: RactiveM | e)
